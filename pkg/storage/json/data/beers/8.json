	"short_description": "Very smooth, medium bodied brew. Malt sweetness is thin, and can be likened to diluted sugar water. Touch of fructose-like sweetness. Light citric hop flavours gently prick the palate with tea-like notes that follow and fade quickly. Finishes a bit dry with husk tannins and a pasty mouthfeel.",
